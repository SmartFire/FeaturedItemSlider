#Featured Item Slider
===

NimblePros created a Feature Item Slider Module for Orchard CMS, but it hasn't been updated to work with Orchard 1.7 and the Media Library.

[Old Featured Item Slider](http://bitbucket.org/nimblepros/orchard-featureditemslider)

I modified the module to work with Orchard 1.7 and the Media Library, fixed a couple of bugs, and updated the ColorPicker and Slimbox plugins to work with the newer version of jQuery.

There are better ways to create this functionality today, but I just wanted to get the old module working and will probably come back and re-write this module at a later time.

##Warning

Do not install this module on an Orchard website that has installed a NimblePros' version of Featured Item Slider.

This module, although named the same and using the original code, does not migrate/upgrade an existing Featured Items Slider by NimblePros on your Orchard Website.

This is expected to be installed on new Orchard 1.7+ websites that did not use the older NimblePros' version of Featured Item Slider.

I needed to do this quickly for a new installation and did not have time to worry about a migration progress.
